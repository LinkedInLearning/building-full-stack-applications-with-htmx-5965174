## Course Description

<p>Get up and running with HTMX in this hands-on course with software developer Fikayo Adepoju. Discover the essentials of building real-world web functionalities with HTMX and a Hypermedia API. Fikayo demonstrates how to use HTMX in your applications by first building common web functionalities like search to find information, paginated tables to manage data, infinite scroll, and a dynamic web form powered by a Hypermedia back end. Along the way, youâ€™ll get a chance to practice your new skills and technical know-how by building a complete application, a blogging platform, from the ground up.</p><p>This course includes Code Challenges powered by CoderPad. Code Challenges are interactive coding exercises with real-time feedback, so you can get hands-on coding practice alongside the course content to advance your programming skills.</p>

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
